# Shopping List

This is another Android project I did while in Budapest. It is a shopping list that allows the user to. In this project, I explored new techniques using realm (a database for android), recyclerview (a very useful view on android), a splash screen, and intent (creating new activities on android).

## Getting Started

If you're interested, all you have to do is fork the repo and enjoy!

### Prerequisites

You will need Android Studio, and an emulator or an Android device.

### Installing

The only thing to note after downloading this is that some parts might be outdated, and the program was built with a specific package. You should probably change the manifest file.
